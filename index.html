<h1>Agile Quitters Manifesto</h1>

<p>
    We have unsuccessfully tried to teach people agile for long time. Through this work we have come to value:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Sleeping well at night over pretending to deliver value</li>
    <li>Personal integrity over having an agile certification</li>
    <li>XP over Scrum</li>
    <li>Anything really over "Scaled" Agile</li>
</ul>
<p>
    That is, while people believe the items on the right have value, there really is none whatsoever. We can't be
    bothered anymore, and are going back to coding. See ya!
